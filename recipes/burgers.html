		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Burgers, specifically cheeseburgers, are a favorite among Americans.  You can't drive through a town without seeing a burger shop.  And it's no wonder; burgers are delicious.  Although there are many different styles, a personal favorite of mine is the smashburger.</p>
		
		<p>Smashburgers are 2-4oz patties, smashed down ultra-thin, and then covered in cheese.  This results in a nice, crispy crust on the outside of the burger, with a juicy patty and gooey cheese.</p>
